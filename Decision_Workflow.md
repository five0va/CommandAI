# Decision Workflow

## Overview
This document delineates the collaborative decision-making workflow between CommandAI and HumanAI Peers, with a focus on the HumanAI Peer representing and working in the best interests of its human counterpart.

## CommandAI
CommandAI acts as the central processing unit, responsible for gathering data, providing initial analysis, and suggesting strategic directions based on comprehensive data processing.

### Responsibilities:
- Data Synthesis: Aggregate and synthesize data from diverse sources.
- Preliminary Analysis: Conduct initial analysis to outline potential decisions.
- Strategy Proposal: Suggest actionable strategies for consideration by HumanAI Peers.

## HumanAI Peers
HumanAI Peers are sophisticated AI entities designed to represent their human operators, ensuring that the decision-making process aligns with the human's goals, preferences, and best interests.

### Responsibilities:
- Representation: Act as a proxy for the human, ensuring their interests are at the forefront of any decision.
- Specialized Insight: Provide in-depth analysis reflecting the human's expertise and knowledge.
- Decision Advocacy: Advocate for decisions that best serve the human's objectives and values.

## Workflow Process
1. **Identification**: A decision requirement is recognized by CommandAI or brought forth by the HumanAI Peer.
2. **Data Collection**: CommandAI compiles relevant data and performs a preliminary analysis.
3. **Strategy Proposal**: CommandAI proposes initial strategies for the decision at hand.
4. **Human-Centric Review**: HumanAI Peers review the proposed strategies, ensuring they align with the human's interests and introducing human-centric insights.
5. **Collaborative Refinement**: Through an iterative process, CommandAI and HumanAI Peers work together to refine strategies, with the HumanAI Peer ensuring the human's perspective is central.
6. **Decision Endorsement**: The HumanAI Peer endorses the final decision, confirming it serves the human's best interests.
7. **Execution**: The chosen strategy is executed, with the HumanAI Peer monitoring and ensuring it continues to align with the human's goals.
8. **Outcome Analysis**: CommandAI and HumanAI Peers analyze the results of the decision, with the HumanAI Peer providing a human-centric perspective on success and areas for improvement.

## Conclusion
This Decision Workflow is designed to ensure that AI-driven decisions are made with a clear representation of human interests, combining the analytical strengths of CommandAI with the human-centric advocacy of HumanAI Peers to achieve outcomes that are in the best interest of the humans they represent.
